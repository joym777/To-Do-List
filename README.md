# ABOUT WEBPAGE 
This is a simple To-Do List webpage for optimized productivity. This page allows the user to add tasks, remove tasks when complete (or not), and stores task list for efficiency even when tab is closed! :) how cool;P
###### This webpage prioritizes my development of core JS skills to create a functional and inteructive webpage.

### Technologies used: 
- HTML 
- CSS 
- JavaScript

## Key JS Skills practiced in the project: 
- Object Oriented JS programming
- Event handling 
- Conditional logic and Control flows
- DOM manipulation and Dynamic Rendering 
- Data structures and management

## Tests conducted and their expected results:
- These are the manual tests made to validate all functionality in the console.

##### 1️⃣ add task functionality 
Used to verify that a new task can be successfully aded to the list with the expectations of having the new task appears on the task list immediately and the total task cound should increase by 1.
##### 2️⃣ Preventing an empty task from being added to list
This ensures that an empty list cannot be added to the talk list and whill alert the user to add a task before submitting the task into the list. 
- This prevents an invalid input and tests conditional control flow.

##### 3️⃣Toggle Completion status of tasks
Used to verify that clicking 'done'/'undo'on the task updates the task's status correctly.
##### 4️⃣ Deleting tasks 
Used to confirm that the task has been removed after clicking the ❌button.
A confirmation message will appear and after a confirmed deletion, the task will disappear from the talk list. 
##### 5️⃣ Task stats update
This ensures that the statistics displayed on the UI are accurate depending on what the user's actions. It updates the total, completed, and pending counts approprietly after every task update.
